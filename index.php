<p class="font-weight-bold" style="margin-left:50px">Computer Engineering</p>
<p class="font-weight-light" style="margin-left:75px;margin-right:75px">Computer Engineering is a branch of engineering dealing with various aspects of computer hardware and software. The branch is closely associated with electronics engineering, as the underlying hardware comprises mainly of microprocessors, microcontrollers, logic gates etc. The engineers on graduation will be able to write software on various verticals of the business environment and would be able to carry out various scientific research projects. Today, with the advent of mobile computing devices, engineers are bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and human intelligence. Moreover, with the growth in research and development in the field of big data, cloud computing and algorithms ask for awareness, as computer engineering is going to be the next big lead in the domain of engineering.</p>

<br>
<p class="font-weight-bold" style="margin-left:50px">Civil Engineering</p>
<p class="font-weight-light" style="margin-left:75px;margin-right:75px">Bachelor of Technology in civil engineering equips the graduates with the fundamentals of civil engineering. The B.Tech degree programme is designed to offer depth in civil engineering technicalities along with the flexibility to select elective courses that meet studentsâ€™ interests and expose them to the breadth of civil engineering specialties.</p>

<br>
<p class="font-weight-bold" style="margin-left:50px">Mechanical Engineering</p>
<p class="font-weight-light" style="margin-left:75px;margin-right:75px">Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering is a Four year Programme, designed to have overall development of students and prepare them for direct induction in the Industries. Besides learning of basic courses of Mechanical Engineering, additional courses on skill development, application of technical learning, innovations and incubations, professional ethics, technical communication, entrepreneurship are included in the curriculum too.</p>

<br>
<p class="font-weight-bold" style="margin-left:50px">Electrical Engineering</p>
<p class="font-weight-light" style="margin-left:75px;margin-right:75px">An electrical engineer is someone who designs and develops new electrical systems, solves problems and tests equipment. They study and apply the physics and mathematics of electricity, electromagnetism and electronics to both large and small scale systems to process information and transmit energy. They work with all kinds of electronic devices, from the smallest pocket devices to large supercomputers. Electrical engineering students learn through a combination of design and lab work. This mix of theory and practical application allows students to visualize concepts and then apply their ideas in a variety of real life situations. Students learn to analyse and diagnose problems and develop innovative solutions.</p>
